# vue-cli-plugin-extensions

This is a plugin for [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org) to add [Vue extensions](https://github.com/nerdocs/vue-extensions) to your app easily.

Just install it with

```bash
vue add extensions
```

The plugin adds the dependency to your application and modifies a few files (namely *main.js*, and creates a *plugins* directory).
You will be prompted for whether you want to add example plugin content - so you have a simple working plugin to start with.
